## Using GitHub

### First-time setup (already done)

```bash
cd "/Users/leekaiyan/Desktop/Flutter Projects/All-in-One-Games"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: All-in-One-Games Flutter project"
git remote add origin https://github.com/thewingsmission/All-in-One-Games.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

- When `git push` asks for a password, use a **Personal Access Token** from GitHub (Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens), not your account password.

### Upload code to GitHub (every time you want to save)

```bash
cd "/Users/leekaiyan/Desktop/Flutter Projects/All-in-One-Games"

git add .
git commit -m "Short description of what you changed"
git push
```

- **`git add .`** — Stage all changed files.
- **`git commit -m "..."`** — Save a snapshot with a message (e.g. `"Add Nerdle shop"`, `"Fix menu"`).
- **`git push`** — Upload your commits to GitHub.

Run these three commands whenever you finish a feature or want to back up your code.
